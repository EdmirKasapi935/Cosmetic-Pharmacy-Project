# Cosmetic-Pharmacy-Project
This was part of a larger cosmetic pharmacy website i had coded together with my friends for a univerity project. For now, it only contains the necessary components which I have worked on, as well as some other components my friends worked on, which are needed for the ebsite to run without problems.<br/>
<br/>
This repository cointains the amin dashbaord togethr with the subscription and contact forms. In order for them to work, you need to have 2 spare accounts. One will be used as the main account to recieve the notifications and the other one will be used to send email notifications between the main email and the client's email. An app password for the second email will be required. You must enable 2FA on that email. Look up the .env file for where to put the required credentials.<br/>
